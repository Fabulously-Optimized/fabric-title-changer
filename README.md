# Main Menu Credits

A Fabric mod that allows modpacks to add their name in main menu's bottom right corner.

This mod is made for [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) and therefore I will probably not add features or fix bugs that are not related to that. Similarly, any Quilt support is currently a side effect, not intentional.
