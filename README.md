# Main Menu Credits

Superseded by https://github.com/isXander/main-menu-credits

~~A Fabric mod that adds a linkable piece of text above Mojang's copyright notice (bottom right corner) in the main menu. Made for [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) but can be freely used in any modpack.~~

~~The text and link are set by the config, other features are not planned. If you want them, use ['Slight' GUI Modifications](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/slight-gui-modifications)' [custom title screen](https://github.com/shedaniel/slight-gui-modifications/wiki/Custom-Title-Screen) or make a pull request and maybe I'll accept it.~~

~~Quilt is currently not explicitly supported, but should work.~~
